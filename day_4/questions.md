## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
  * A function allows us to make a large block of code which does a specific task in multiple steps and then be able to call up that entire block with one name instead of having to write down all those blocks each time we need to use the function.

1. What is a parameter?
  * Pieces of information that are passed to a function.

1. What is a return value?
  * This is the response or information we get back from the function.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

```
function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am")
}

hello();
```

1. Create a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

```
function hello_someone() {
  console.log(name + " I am")
}

var name = "Sam"

```

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
```
hello_someone()
```
1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
  * None that I can articulate at the moment.
