1. First make an variable that is an array of each letter in the alphabet, with each letter being its own string. This will give each string an index number, with which we can refer to later as an integer.  'A' will equal '1', 'B' is '2' and so on.
2. Make a function that loops through whatever phrase is entered into the cipher  and record the numerical value of each letter in the phrase by comparing it to the indexs of the alphabet array.  
3. The method will have a parameter into which you enter how many index values to the left or right you want to go(using '+' or "-").  Z is 26 so if the shift is two to the left then 24 should return, thus giving us the letter W.
4.  Once all of the math has been done by the function and we have the new numbers in hand (due to the adding or subtracting of the numerical value within the index) the program then again references our alphabet array in order to turn these new numbers into the new letters they represent within the alphabet array.
5.  Once the new letters are returned the phrase is put back together again, now in the secret Ceasar language of our choosing.  The program must also translate the spaces between words to be spaces again in the new Ceasar phrase.
